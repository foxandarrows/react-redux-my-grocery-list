# A grocery list, with React & Redux

[Demo](https://foxandarrows.github.io/my-grocery-list/)

This is NOT a copy - paste tutorial, this is an app created based on the experiment / reading of several tutorials:

- https://redux.js.org/basics/example
- Pluralsight : Redux Flow (Cory House: Create a simple Add Course Form)
- https://www.codingame.com (Simple Redux Create Delete Contact Application)
- https://codeburst.io (Redux-A CRUD Example)
- Rem Zolotykh on YouTube (CRUD with Redux #10. Delete Game)

Under the hood, I have also used :

- Material Icons
- Styled Components
